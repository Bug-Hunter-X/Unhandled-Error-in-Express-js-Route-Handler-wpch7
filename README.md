This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling in route handlers. The `bug.js` file shows a route that attempts to access a user from an array without checking for the existence of the user. This can lead to unexpected behavior such as undefined errors or crashes. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with error handling to address this issue.
